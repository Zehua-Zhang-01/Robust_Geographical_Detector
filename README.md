# Robust_Geographical_Detector
Code and explanations for the statistical method - 'Robust Geographical Detector' (Gold Open Access) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102782
The article 'Robust Geographical Detector' released in 2022 was my first research publication. This is an improved statistical analysis techniques in assisting (1) find statistical associations between variables, and (2) show some spatial patterns / features through statistical groups. The method was built based on 'A measure of spatial stratified heterogeneity' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052)

Q: Why 'Robust Geographical Detector' is different?
A: We introduced an optimization algorithm - 'Change point detection' to find optimal statistical groups that could tell the maximum statistical associations between variables. The input one-dimensional series is the dependent variable values sorted by the rank of independent variable. 

I was inspired by the release of 'ruptures' Python (https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/) and the review article 'Selective review of offline change point detection methods' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.107299)
